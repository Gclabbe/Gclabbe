## 💞️ Seeking a long-term career in ML ... the focus is less important than the mission 
* meaning, CV vs NLP vs others ... not as important as the task
    * subset ... an opportunity in health careers would be amazing
        * sub-subset ... it's pretty much also amazing to make a better world through all ML skills :)
