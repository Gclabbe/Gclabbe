... site under construction.  I have sooo many projects that are parked under Bitbucket and not visible here :(

## üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in Machine Learning / AI / Robotics / Computer Vision
### ... I have worked in all of these techs
* CV
      * Hand identification in micro-environment equipment ... released 2017 ... trade secret
      * Employee behavior monitoring ... released 2017 ... trade secret
* Predictive Maintenance
      * Oil pump card aberant behavior alerts ... really should be patented
      * O&G Field Equipment downtime ... blocked by corporate lack of records to identify un-intended downtimes
* Robotics
      * minor degree is robotics
      * first 8 years of my career was micro-robotics ... with sub-spec in digital controls theorty
            - and seriuosly, we were the first part of the digitization of the controls of drives
            - seriously, that was not a great time to be a newcomer ... I learned a lot about tech transformation
* Business Analytics
      * Revision of devision email decision systems ... released 2016
          * 90 day report system on forecast problems reduced to 3 days
          * Vendor contracts re-negotiated ... details not known
          * Time 

## üå± I‚Äôm currently learning
* Fourth Brain AI program on Machine Learning Engineering
    *  Regressions
    *  Neural Networks
    *  Individual project -- Covid forecasting
    *  Capstone (TBD)
* University of Colorado MS in Data Science
    * Courses completed
        * Ethics in DS
        * Basics in HPC
        * Algorithms
    * Pending courses
        * HPC
        * Stats
        * ML

## Background
* Years overseas running multi-country division
    * World-Wide ownership for Global Failure Analysis Strategic Planning
    * 7 campuses in Thailand, China, Malaysia, Korea, Singapore
    * 2-years living in China, 2-years living in Thailand
    * WW Customer Service ... constant contact with key customers
    * WW Failure Analysis ... leadership for all 12 campuses
    * Massive project using Random Forest
        * Increased visibility to key problems by 100%+++
        * Reduced staffing from 600 - 350 over 3 years
        
* Before that was many leadership roles.  Key skills
    * Project management
    * Firmware / software delivery (SCRUM / Agile)

    * Multi-team collaboration
    * Strategic alignment between divisions

## üå± I have learned
* Tensorflow2 -- Deeplearning.ai
* John's Hopkin's -- Data Science in R
* Standford DS -- Machine Learning in Octave (Matlab)
* Business Management -- Harvard Business School
* Six Sigma Black Belt
* Problem Solving & Decision Making -- Kepneger-Tregoe

## üíûÔ∏è Seeking a long-term career in ML ... the focus is less important than the mission 
* meaning, CV vs NLP vs others ... not as important as the task
    * subset ... an opportunity in health careers would be amazing
        * sub-subset ... it's pretty much also amazing to make a better world through all ML skills :)
